### Scientific Background

couple sentences of biological/scientific context
motivate interest in a broad line of inquiry

### Data Description

what is being measured? with what platform?
how many samples? are replicates biological or technical?
how any conditions or populations? make sure your report samples, replicates etc in that context

### Work Plan

outline of analyses you can probably do with this data to answer those questions
GET SPECIFIC, at least as specific as you can
"identify differentially expressed genes between the wild type and the knockout" is better than "conduct appropriate statistical analyses"
even better is to enhance with more specifics, e.g. you anticipate using a linear model as implemented in limma
