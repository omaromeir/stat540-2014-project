### Scientific Background

<!-- couple sentences of biological/scientific context
motivate interest in a broad line of inquiry -->

To identify genes that 

### Data Description

<!-- 
1. what is being measured?
2. with what platform?
3. how many samples? 
4. are replicates biological or technical?-->

1. ?
2. Microarray.
3. 31 samples, split into 3 groups: 11 control samples, 10 Crohn's disease patients, 10 ulcerative colitis patients.
4. ?

### Work Plan

<!-- outline of analyses you can probably do with this data to answer those questions
GET SPECIFIC, at least as specific as you can
"identify differentially expressed genes between the wild type and the knockout" is better than "conduct appropriate statistical analyses"
even better is to enhance with more specifics, e.g. you anticipate using a linear model as implemented in limma -->
